## Overview
ESU (Erinis Street Urchin) is a highly interactive stax creature combo deck that seeks to either win quickly with highly efficient creature combos or grind the game to a halt and sneak out a win at instant speed.

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Why you should play this deck:
___
* You like having a lot of agency throughout the game
* You like winning through non-creature counterspells
* You like being tricky with combos that nobody knows about
* You like having one-card win-conditions
* You having incredibly potent stax pieces that shut down most decks and combos in the format
___

===panel: Why you shouldn't play this deck:
___
* You really enjoy casting [[Thassa's Oracle]]
* You prefer to conform and play a pile of generic good stuff
* You assumed this would be a "turn your brain off" gruul deck. Nah.
* You don't want to put tons of hours into learning all the lines and interactions to pilot the deck well.
___
===endpanel
===endaccordion
___
The deck normally wins with:
* [[Conspicuous Snoop]] lines
* [[Hermit Druid]] lines
* [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] combos
* Cheating [[Protean Hulk]] into play and sacrificing him with our sac-outlet in the command zone

Let's go ahead and start by talking about the strengths of this very potent and versatile deck:
* **Board Control** - [[Street Urchin]] gives [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] the ability to sacrifice artifacts and creatures to ping creatures.. but with deathtouch. So it's hard removal. You can stop creature combos, remove your stax pieces, other peoples stax pieces, draw engines, etc at the most optimal timing.
* **Land Recursion** - [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]]'s ability to recur lands every turn provides significant acceleration, enabling us to play much higher impact spells and much more quickly. It also allows us to play very well under [[Collector Ouphe]] and [[Trinisphere]].
* **Sacrifice Outlet** - Having a sacrifice outlet in the command zone allows us to sacrifice [[Protean Hulk]] consistently and tutor for a multitude of creature packages that win the game at instant speed and/or through interaction.
* **Infinite Outlet in the Zone** - The deck can exploit the 1 damage coming from [[Street Urchin]] as an infinite outlet for infinite mana + infinite artifacts/creatures. This is usually enabled through either [[Conspicuous Snoop]] combos, [[Hermit Druid]] combos, or [[gaea's cradle]] loops.

## The Technical Stuff
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Mulligans

You can mulligan for three types of hands, but first:

- Evaluate your pod for the right stax piece.
- Evaluate your position in the pod.

**1. Fast Stax:**  
Decide if a turn 1/turn 2 Trinisphere/Null Rod will slow the game enough. These hands need fetch lands since accessing all mountain/forest targets helps break parity.

**2. Fast Erinis + Value or Tutor Piece:**  
Hands like turn 1 Erinis into turn 2 Toski can dominate if Rogsi isn't present. Including an Urza's Saga allows you to find a stax piece before turn 4. Fetch lands are less critical but still valuable for attacking-based value generation.

**3. Fast Combo:**  
Occasionally, you can push for an early win by turn 3. These hands aren’t what you typically mulligan for, but you should keep them when they show up. Sometimes you can outpace Rogsi.

If your hand doesn’t fit these categories, I recommend binning it. A turn 2 Erinis with a fetch in the graveyard should be your absolute floor, but you want one of the above interactive game plans backing it up.

___
[[Protean Hulk]] is our primary goal, as it enables us to win the game through loads of interaction and sometimes at instant speed.

I've created a flow chart of hulk piles that you would want to use depending on the situation you're in:

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Sorcery Speed Wins
___
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Dockside makes at least 5
___
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: You're worried about creature removal
___
* Hulk Pile: [[Dockside Extortionist]] + [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]] + [[Sylvan Safekeeper]] + [[Tinder Wall]]
___
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Dryad Arbor is in library and you have a forest fetchland accessible
___
1. Everything comes into play off of [[Protean Hulk]] and [[Dockside Extortionist]] triggers, creating 5+ treasures.
2. If beneficial, sacrifice 5 treasures to [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], getting [[Cursed Mirror]], copying [[Dockside Extortionist]], making 5+ treasures.
3. Sacrifice 5 treasures to [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], getting [[Cloudstone Curio]].
5. Fetch for [[Dryad Arbor]]. [[Cloudstone Curio]] triggers and returns [[Dockside Extortionist]] to hand.
6. Go to Main Phase 2 and sacrifice [[Tinder Wall]] to add [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] to recast [[Dockside Extortionist]].
7. Present loop with bouncing [[Dockside Extortionist]] and [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], making infinite treasures and then shoot everyone to death.

Extra: If the loop feeds [[Rhystic Study]], loop [[Cursed Mirror]] and [[Dockside Extortionist]] instead. (Yes, [[Cursed Mirror]] isn't an artifact when it copies a creature, so it works with [[Cloudstone Curio]])
___
===endpanel

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Dryad Arbor is in library, you don't have a forest fetchland accessible, you have Erinis out, and you haven't gone to combat yet
___
- Add [[Dryad Arbor]] to the hulk pile
___
1. Everything comes into play off of [[Protean Hulk]] and [[Dockside Extortionist]] triggers, hopefully creating 5+ treasures.
2. If beneficial, sacrifice 5 treasures to [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], getting [[Cursed Mirror]], copying [[Dockside Extortionist]], making 5+ treasures.
3. Sacrifice 5 treasures to [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], getting [[Cloudstone Curio]].
4. Sacrifice [[Dryad Arbor]] to [[Sylvan Safekeeper]], giving [[Dockside Extortionist]] shroud.
5. Go to combat and attack with [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]], returning [[Dryad Arbor]]. [[Cloudstone Curio]] triggers and returns [[Dockside Extortionist]].
6. Go to Main Phase 2 and sacrifice [[Tinder Wall]] to add [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] to recast [[Dockside Extortionist]].
7. Present loop with bouncing [[Dockside Extortionist]] and [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], making infinite treasures and then shoot everyone to death.

===panel: Dockside makes 8+
___
When this is the case, your [[Cursed Mirror]] doubles the dockside, totaling 10+ treasures. You can then use [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]] to grab a [[Trinisphere]] before you grab your [[Cloudstone Curio]], hopefully stopping future interaction.

___
[[Dockside Extortionist]] + [[Temur Sabertooth]] (+ [[Dryad Arbor]])
___
This is our last resort hulk pile. It relies on very little cards and if you have some extra mana, you can protect your creatures while killing your opponents. This only works if [[Dockside Extortionist]] adds 5+ treasures and we have enough mana prior to [[Dockside Extortionist]]'s trigger to save him with the [[Temur Sabertooth]] if necessary. The steps are quite simple:
    1. Make 5+ treasures from [[Dockside Extortionist]].
    2. Return [[Dockside Extortionist]] to hand with [[Temur Sabertooth]].
    3. Recast [[Dockside Extortionist]] and present loop.
    4. This allows us to infinitely create treasures and ping our opponents to death with [[Street Urchin]].
    
* **Positives:** Requires very little and we can sometimes kill our opponents on the same turn that we protect our creatures.
* **Negatives:** This loses to an opponent's [[Null Rod]], [[Cursed Totem]], or [[Rule of Law]] effects. It also requires Dockside to give us 5+ treasures.
___
===endpanel

===endpanel
===endaccordion
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Dockside only makes 4
___
- Hulk Pile: [[Dockside Extortionist]] + [[Goblin Engineer]] + [[Torch Courier]] + [[Sylvan Safekeeper]]
- [[Dryad Arbor]] if it's in library and you haven't gone to combat yet and have no forest fetchland accessible
___
This is a hulk pile that fills a particular niche. It can win if [[Dockside Extortionist]] makes 4+ treasures. The line is a little complex:
1. Everything comes into play off of [[Protean Hulk]] and [[Dockside Extortionist]] triggers, hopefully creating 4+ treasures.
2. [[Goblin Engineer]] also triggers, putting [[Cloudstone Curio]] into the graveyard.
3. Sacrifice [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Goblin Engineer]] haste.
4. Sacrifice a treasure for a red and another to active [[Goblin Engineer]], putting [[Cloudstone Curio]] into play.
5. If [[Dryad Arbor]] is already out, sacrifice it to [[Sylvan Safekeeper]], giving [[Dockside Extortionist]] shroud.
6. Go to combat and attack with [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]], returning [[Dryad Arbor]] or fetch for it. [[Cloudstone Curio]] triggers and returns [[Dockside Extortionist]].
7. Go to Main Phase 2 and sacrifice the other two treasures to add [[symbol:r]][[symbol:r]] and recast [[Dockside Extortionist]].
8. Present loop with [[Dockside Extortionist]] and [[Sylvan Safekeeper]] and then shoot everyone to death.

* **Positives:** Only requires [[Dockside Extortionist]] to give us 4+ treasures.
* **Negatives:** Loses to [[Cursed Totem]], [[Torpor Orb]], [[Null Rod]], and [[Rule of Law]] effects.

===panel: Dockside just sucks right now?
[[Goblin Recruiter]] + [[Conspicuous Snoop]] + 
* ([[Torch Courier]] if you don't want to have to cast another spell. Or if there's a [[Drannith Magistrate]], etc.)
* ([[Sylvan Safekeeper]] if you can convince the players that your creatures are completely protected from removal. You can't actually have snoop target itself if it has shroud.)
* ([[Tinder Wall]] if you need mana for [[Tibalt's Trickery]] or something similar)
* ([[Masked Vandal]] if you need to remove a [[Blind Obedience]], [[Rule of Law]], or [[Cursed Totem]], etc)
___
This is our secondary [[Protean Hulk]] pile and it wins by:
1. Stacking the library with [[Goblin Recruiter]], putting [[Torch Courier]] on top if necessary, then [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]], then [[Skirk Prospector]] if it's not already out. 
2. You cast [[Torch Courier]] if necessary, sacrifice [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste.
3. With [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on the top of your library, you can have [[Conspicuous Snoop]] make infinite copies of itself. 
4. The last copy of [[Conspicuous Snoop]] is untapped and you can use it to make a copy of your [[Goblin Recruiter]], stacking the deck again to have [[Skirk Prospector]] on top, then [[Dockside Extortionist]] under it. 
5. You can then sacrifice infinite [[Conspicuous Snoop]]s to gain infinite [[symbol:r]] from [[Skirk Prospector]]
6. You can cast [[Skirk Prospector]] off the top, then cast [[Dockside Extortionist]] off the top if you need the extra [[symbol:g]] to recast [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]]
7. Ping them to death with [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] + [[Street Urchin]]. 
    
* **Positives:** This gets around [[Rule of Law]] and [[Null Rod]]
* **Negatives:** Loses to [[Cursed Totem]] and [[Torpor Orb]] effects unless you hit it with [[Masked Vandal]]. Although the [[Sylvan Safekeeper]] keeps our board safe, the [[Conspicuous Snoop]] needs to be able to target itself with [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]]'s ability, so it forces us to wait until our next turn to try again if someone tries to remove the [[Conspicuous Snoop]].

___
[[Goblin Recruiter]]
___
**Snoop Combo**
1. Cast [[Goblin Recruiter]] and put [[Conspicuous Snoop]] on top of your library, and then under that is [[Torch Courier]], [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]], and [[Skirk Prospector]]. 
2. Find a way to draw a card or wait a turn and cast [[Conspicuous Snoop]]
3. Cast [[Torch Courier]] off the top of your library, and then sacrifice [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste. 
4. Then, with the [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on the top, activate Snoop to copy himself over and over again. 
5. The last copy of Snoop is untapped and you can use it to make a copy of your [[Goblin Recruiter]], stacking the deck again to have [[Skirk Prospector]] on top. 
6. You can then sacrifice infinite Snoops to gain infinite [[symbol:r]] from [[Skirk Prospector]] and then ping them to death with [[Street Urchin]].
7. (You can add [[Dockside Extortionist]] to the mix if you need the extra mana or [[symbol:g]] to recast [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] and add [[Masked Vandal]] (Yeah, it's a goblin) to remove a stax piece like cursed totem.)
___

**Dockside + Goblin Engineer Combo**

(Do this if Dockside makes 4+ treasures and you have a creature in hand. You'll have to do some calculating.)
1. Cast [[Goblin Recruiter]] and put [[Conspicuous Snoop]] on top of your library, and then under that is [[Dockside Extortionist]], [[Skirk Prospector]], [[Torch Courier]], and [[Goblin Engineer]].
2. Find a way to draw a card or wait a turn and cast [[Conspicuous Snoop]].
3. Cast [[Dockside Extortionist]] off the top and the let's assume the tightest feasible situation: you have 2 mana left and you make exactly 4 treasures. (Or more treasures, less mana available)
4. Use [[Conspicuous Snoop]]'s copied [[Skirk Prospector]] ability to sac [[Goblin Recruiter]] for a [[symbol:r]].
5. Cast [[Skirk Prospector]] and [[Torch Courier]] off the top with the [[symbol:r]] and an available mana.
6. Cast [[Goblin Engineer]] off the top with the last available mana and a treasure. Go find [[Cloudstone Curio]].
7. Sacrifice [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Goblin Engineer]] haste.
8. Activate [[Goblin Engineer]] with a treasure and sacrifice an artifact/treasure to return [[Cloudstone Curio]] from graveyard to battlefield.
9. Sacrifice [[Goblin Engineer]] to [[Skirk Prospector]] for a [[symbol:r]].
10. Cast a creature from hand using a treasure/[[symbol:r]] (tightest feasible situation requires a 1 drop). 
11. Bounce [[Dockside Extortionist]] from [[Cloudstone Curio]].
12. Sacrifice [[Skirk Prospector]] to its own ability for a [[symbol:r]] if you already have a 1 drop. We now have 2 [[symbol:r]] left.
13. Cast [[Dockside Extortionist]] with the treasure and [[symbol:r]], making 4 treasures, and looping with [[Skirk Prospector]] to make infinite treasures.
14. Shoot everyone down.

===panel: Notable Inclusions
1. **[[Sensei's Divining Top]]:** 
* It serves these purposes:
    * Uncounterably cracking recruiter piles
    * Great card filtering with all the fetching we do
    * It's a bullet we can sac in response to tapping it to draw
    * It's important for winning under a drannith when we crack hulk or go for dockside + magda
    * It's important for winning through The One Ring
===endpanel

===panel: Notable Exclusions
1. **( [[Dualcaster Mage]] + [[Twinflame]]/[[Heat Shimmer]] ):** This is a two card combo that makes infinite [[Dualcaster Mage]]s with haste.
* This has been excluded because the deck is already very dense with win-conditions and [[Twinflame]]/[[Heat Shimmer]] are impossible to tutor without [[gamble]]. I've also decided to prioritize card quality over additional win-conditions.

===panel: Interaction
Even though this deck is clearly less fast and consistent than [[Minsc, Beloved Ranger]], we have quite a lot more stax and interaction than they do in order to slow down faster combo decks like [[Ad Nauseam]] decks and creature-oriented/commander-centered decks like [[Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer]], [[Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy]], [[Najeela, the Blade-Blossom]], etc.

1. The most obvious ways we slow these decks down is our quite consistent removal in the command zone. When [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] and [[Street Urchin]] are out together, we have the ability "1, Sacrifice another creature or an artifact: destroy target creature."
2. We can play stax pieces that sometimes restrict our combos because we can remove them with our [[Street Urchin]]. ex: [[Trinisphere]], [[Manglehorn]], [[Null Rod]], and [[Collector Ouphe]].
3. We play plenty of interactive spells for protecting our combos or disrupting our opponents.

===panel: Weaknesses
This deck does have some weaknesses that you would certainly expect:

* **[[Humility]]** - Most decks come to a screeching halt when this card comes into play. Luckily, we have [[Boseiju, Who Endures]] to deal with it and a few ways to get it.* 

**[[Torpor Orb]]** - Only [[Conspicuous Snoop]] + [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on top combos win through this.

* **[[Null Rod]] & [[Stony Silence]]** - [[Dockside Extortionist]] combos get shut down, but that's it.

* **[[Cursed Totem]]** - Very Crippling. [[Dockside Extortionist]] + [[Cloudstone Curio]] can make infinite mana, but you'll still need to remove this to win. We have a hulk line that wins while removing it with [[Masked Vandal]].

* **[[Linvala, Keeper of Silence]]** - Most difficult card to deal with. [[Dockside Extortionist]] + [[Cloudstone Curio]] can make infinite mana, but you'll still need to remove this. We only have a few inefficient answers to this: [[Barbarian Ring]] if [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] is out to recur it, and [[Legolas's Quick Reflexes]].

* **[[Grafdigger's Cage]]** - [[Dockside Extortionist]] and [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] combos get around it, but it still is a painful stax piece to deal with.

* **[[Drannith Magistrate]]** - Problematic if our commanders aren't out, obviously. We have a few ways to deal with it, but they aren't pretty. We can remove it with [[Collateral Damage]], [[Legolas's Quick Reflexes]], and a [[Barbarian Ring]] if [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] is out to recur it. [[Command Beacon]] also allows us to get around it without removing it. [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] combos win through it. We can also win with [[Dockside Extortionist]] and [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]] by making infinite treasures with [[Cloudstone Curio]] and then drawing our deck with [[Sensei's Divining Top]].
