## Overview
ESU (Erinis Street Urchin) is a highly interactive stax creature combo deck that seeks to either win quickly with highly efficient creature combos or grind the game to a halt and sneak out a win at instant speed.

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Why you should play this deck:
___
* You like having a lot of agency throughout the game
* You like winning through non-creature counterspells
* You like being tricky with combos that nobody knows about
* You like having one-card win-conditions
* You having incredibly potent stax pieces that shut down most decks and combos in the format
___

===panel: Why you shouldn't play this deck:
___
* You really enjoy casting [[Thassa's Oracle]]
* You prefer to conform and play a pile of generic good stuff
* You assumed this would be a "turn your brain off" gruul deck. Nah.
* You don't want to put tons of hours into learning all the lines and interactions to pilot the deck well.
___
===endpanel
===endaccordion
___
The deck normally wins with:
* [[Conspicuous Snoop]] lines
* [[Hermit Druid]] lines
* [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] combos
* Cheating [[Protean Hulk]] into play and sacrificing him with our sac-outlet in the command zone

Let's go ahead and start by talking about the strengths of this very potent and versatile deck:
* **Board Control** - [[Street Urchin]] gives [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] the ability to sacrifice artifacts and creatures to ping creatures.. but with deathtouch. So it's hard removal. You can stop creature combos, remove your stax pieces, other peoples stax pieces, draw engines, etc at the most optimal timing.
* **Land Recursion** - [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]]'s ability to recur lands every turn provides significant acceleration, enabling us to play much higher impact spells and much more quickly. It also allows us to play very well under [[Collector Ouphe]] and [[Trinisphere]].
* **Sacrifice Outlet** - Having a sacrifice outlet in the command zone allows us to sacrifice [[Protean Hulk]] consistently and tutor for a multitude of creature packages that win the game at instant speed and/or through interaction.
* **Infinite Outlet in the Zone** - The deck can exploit the 1 damage coming from [[Street Urchin]] as an infinite outlet for infinite mana + infinite artifacts/creatures. This is usually enabled through either [[Conspicuous Snoop]] combos, [[Hermit Druid]] combos, or [[gaea's cradle]] loops.

## The Technical Stuff
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Mulligans

You can mulligan for three types of hands, but first:

- Evaluate your pod for the right stax piece.
- Evaluate your position in the pod.

**1. Fast Stax:**  
Decide if a turn 1/turn 2 Trinisphere/Null Rod will slow the game enough. These hands need fetch lands since accessing all mountain/forest targets helps break parity.

**2. Fast Erinis + Value or Tutor Piece:**  
Hands like turn 1 Erinis into turn 2 Toski can dominate if Rogsi isn't present. Including an Urza's Saga allows you to find a stax piece before turn 4. Fetch lands are less critical but still valuable for attacking-based value generation.

**3. Fast Combo:**  
Occasionally, you can push for an early win by turn 3. These hands aren’t what you typically mulligan for, but you should keep them when they show up. Sometimes you can outpace Rogsi.

If your hand doesn’t fit these categories, I recommend binning it. A turn 2 Erinis with a fetch in the graveyard should be your absolute floor, but you want one of the above interactive game plans backing it up.

___
[[Protean Hulk]] is our primary goal, as it enables us to win the game through loads of interaction and sometimes at instant speed.

I've created a flow chart of hulk piles that you would want to use depending on the situation you're in:

===accordion|autocollapse

___
===endpanel
===endaccordion
===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Instant Speed Wins
[[Goblin Recruiter]] + [[Conspicuous Snoop]] + [[Torch Courier]]
* ([[Sylvan Safekeeper]] if you can convince the players that your creatures are completely protected from removal. You can't actually have snoop target itself if it has shroud.)
* ([[Tinder Wall]] if you need mana for [[Tibalt's Trickery]] or something similar)
___
1. Stacking the library with [[Goblin Recruiter]], putting [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on top.
2. Sacrifice [[Torch Courier]] to give [[Conspicuous Snoop]] haste.
3. With [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on the top of your library, you can have [[Conspicuous Snoop]] make infinite copies of itself. 
4. The last copy of [[Conspicuous Snoop]] is untapped and you can use it to make a copy of your [[Goblin Recruiter]], stacking the deck again to put [[Skirk Prospector]] on top.
5. You can then sacrifice infinite [[Conspicuous Snoop]]s to gain infinite [[symbol:r]] from [[Skirk Prospector]]
6. Ping them to death with [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] + [[Street Urchin]]. 
    
* **Positives:** This gets around [[Rule of Law]] and [[Null Rod]] and wins at instant speed
* **Negatives:** Loses to [[Cursed Totem]] and [[Torpor Orb]] effects. Although the [[Sylvan Safekeeper]] keeps our board safe, the [[Conspicuous Snoop]] needs to be able to target itself with [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]]'s ability, so it forces us to wait until our next turn to try again if someone tries to remove the [[Conspicuous Snoop]].

1. Activate your Shifting Woodland copying breach, it's ok to tap out for this.

1. **[[Sensei's Divining Top]]:** 
* It serves these purposes:
    * Uncounterably cracking recruiter piles and reorganizing at instant speed if necessary
    * Great card filtering with all the fetching we do
    * It's a bullet we can sac in response to tapping it to draw
    * It's useful to grab off of Urza's Saga
    * It's powerful with Powerbalance
===endpanel

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Notable Exclusions
1. **( [[Dualcaster Mage]] + [[Twinflame]]/[[Heat Shimmer]] ):** This is a two card combo that makes infinite [[Dualcaster Mage]]s with haste.
* This has been excluded because the deck is already very dense with win-conditions and [[Twinflame]]/[[Heat Shimmer]] are impossible to tutor without [[gamble]]. I've also decided to prioritize card quality over additional win-conditions.
===endpanel
===endaccordion

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Interaction
Even though this deck is a bit less fast and consistent than something like [[Minsc, Beloved Ranger]] (a dedicated hulk + kiki deck), we have quite a lot more stax and interaction than they do in order to slow down faster combo decks like [[Ad Nauseam]] decks and creature-oriented/commander-centered decks like [[Rocco, Cabaretti Caterer]], [[Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy]], [[Najeela, the Blade-Blossom]], etc.

1. The most obvious ways we slow these decks down is our quite consistent removal in the command zone. When [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]] and [[Street Urchin]] are out together, we have the ability "1, Sacrifice another creature or an artifact: destroy target creature."
2. We can play stax pieces that sometimes restrict our combos because we can remove them with our [[Street Urchin]]. ex: [[Trinisphere]], [[Manglehorn]], [[Null Rod]], and [[Collector Ouphe]].
3. We play plenty of interactive spells for protecting our combos or disrupting our opponents.

===endpanel

===accordion|autocollapse
===panel: Weaknesses
This deck does have some weaknesses that you would certainly expect:

* **[[Humility]]** - Most decks come to a screeching halt when this card comes into play. Luckily, we have [[Boseiju, Who Endures]] to deal with it and a few ways to get it.* 

**[[Torpor Orb]]** - Only [[Conspicuous Snoop]] + [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] on top combos win through this.

* **[[Cursed Totem]]** - Very Crippling. We have a hulk line that wins while removing it with [[Masked Vandal]].

* **[[Linvala, Keeper of Silence]]** - Most difficult card to deal with. We only have a few answers to this: 7 tutors for [[Talon Gates of Madara]] and [[Legolas's Quick Reflexes]] on [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]].

* **[[Grafdigger's Cage]]** - [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] combos get around it and technically snoop if you work around not casting off of the top, but it still is a painful stax piece to deal with. Stops [[Hermit Druid]]. We have [[Boseiju, Who Endures]] and [[Masked Vandal]] and many many tutors for both.

* **[[Drannith Magistrate]]** - Problematic if our commanders aren't out, obviously. We only have a few answers to this: 7 tutors for [[Talon Gates of Madara]] and [[Legolas's Quick Reflexes]] on [[Erinis, Gloom Stalker]]. [[Command Beacon]] also allows us to get around it without removing it. [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]] combos win through it. Same with [[Conspicuous Snoop]] sometimes.
